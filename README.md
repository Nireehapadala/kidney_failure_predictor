# kidney_failure_predictor
A machine learning model that predicts the risk of kidney failure using patient health indicators. Built with Python and trained on clinical data for early detection.

🧪 Kidney Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of kidney failure using patient health data. Early prediction can assist healthcare professionals in taking timely actions to prevent critical stages of kidney disease.

🩺 Project Goal
To develop, train, and evaluate machine learning models that can classify patients at risk of kidney failure based on clinical parameters.

🧠 Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Pandas – data handling

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning algorithms and evaluation

📊 Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains multiple clinical indicators such as:

age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar

blood urea, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, etc.

The target variable is a binary class indicating kidney disease presence or absence.

Missing values were handled, and categorical features were encoded.
